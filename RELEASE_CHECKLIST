This is a checklist of the steps to follow when preparing a new release.

  * git fetch origin
    git merge origin/master

  * Update ChangeLog.

  * Update lib_mysqludf_str.html.

  * Update the package version that is passed to AC_INIT in configure.ac.

  * Update the macro def of PACKAGE_VERSION in config.h (for Windows/Visual Studio
    users).

  * Make sure that there are no uncommitted changes in the working tree. Push
    all commits to GitHub.

  * Update RELEASE_CHECKLIST if necessary.


ON WINDOWS
================================================================================
  * Update MySQL to the latest GA release.

  * Build Debug and Release binaries using the Visual Studio solution.

  * Use Dependency Walker to inspect the DLL dependencies of the Release binary.
    Make sure that there are no unusual dependencies.

  * Install the newly-built DLL to the MySQL plugin directory.

  * Source uninstalldb.sql, then installdb.sql, to make sure that there are no
    obvious problems.

  * Make sure that the new version is listed in the result of:
    SELECT lib_mysqludf_str_info() FROM DUAL;

  * Commit any changes in the working tree. Push all commits to GitHub.

  * Prepare a ZIP of the Release build. The ZIP should contain a copy of
    COPYING, installdb.sql, lib_mysqludf_str.dll, README.win_build, and
    uninstalldb.sql. The name should be "lib_mysqludf_str-$(PACKAGE_VERSION)_MySQL-$(MYSQL_VERSION)_x64".

  * Upload the ZIP to GitHub. The brief description should be
    "Build of lib_mysqludf_str $(PACKAGE_VERSION) for MySQL $(MYSQL_VERSION) (Win64)"

  * Sign the ZIP with GPG.


ON LINUX
================================================================================
  * git fetch origin
    git merge origin/master

  * make clean
    autoreconf
    ./configure --prefix /usr/local/stow/lib_mysqludf_str-HEAD --disable-static
    make
    sudo make install

  * Examine the files in /usr/local/stow/lib_mysqludf_str-HEAD

  * ldd /usr/local/stow/lib_mysqludf_str-HEAD/lib/lib_mysqludf_str.so

  * Commit any changes in the working tree. Push all commits to GitHub.

  * Create a signed tag named "v$(PACKAGE_VERSION)":
    gpg -s v$(PACKAGE_VERSION)

    Message: "Version $(PACKAGE_VERSION)"

  * git push --tags origin
