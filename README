MySQL UDF Repository
lib_mysqludf_str

-----------------------

MySQL already includes many string functions natively. However, this function repository is not exhaustive and other string functions can ease the development of MySQL-based applications. Users coming from PHP or Perl background, for instance, may expect to find their entire set of string functions in MySQL. lib_mysqludf_str aims to offer a library of string functions which can complement the native one.

For information about using this library, please see API

-----------------------

To build:
 ./configure
 make && make install

To then load the functions:
 mysql -u root -p < installdb.sql

To remove the library from your system:
 mysql -u root -p < uninstalldb.sql
 make uninstall
